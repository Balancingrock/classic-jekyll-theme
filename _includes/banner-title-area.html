This file is for customization of the title and subtitle in the banner.

Do not change the name of any of the classes!

If customization is needed, don't put anything in here, but keep the file.

Note that simple title & subtitle can also be assigned through the settings in the classic-jekyll-theme.scss file.

Be aware that this title-area is arranged outside the DOM and as such does not drive the size of the the banner.

To display/not-display and elements use the '.display-flex-...' classes en '.display-block-...' classes. (See _sass/_theme-library.scss for more.

Example: <div class='myclass display-block-narrow'><p>Hello</p></div>

Will display the text "Hello" only when the narrow layout is in use.
