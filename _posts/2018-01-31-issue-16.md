5shekel discovered a problem with the youtube-player widget. Unfortunately it does not seem possible to solve this issue in HTML/CSS. A Javascript solution might be possible but that investigation is currently not scheduled.

The problem:

When using the `banner-position: top-fixed` (setup.yml) a video that is included through the youtube-player.html widget will scroll in front of the banner/menu content.

Work around:

Include the video directly in markdown using iframe's.

The drawback is that the video will not auto-resize with the width of the column, and likely you will need to specify a height/width for the video in the iframe specification.

Files changed:

`_data\setup.yml` was updated to include a recommendation not to use the youtube widget for top-fixed.
