This release addresses an omission that was made when creating v2.0.

Up to now it was not posible to specify the color of a menu item when it was selected, though it was possible to specify the background color. This has now been fixed.

The files `_sass/classic/_menubar.scss` has undergone a few minor updates, and in the file `_sass/classic-jekyll-theme.scss` some additions have been made.

To keep the naming of items harmonised, the `...item-hover-color-...` names have been converted into `...item-color-hover-...`

A page over creating cron-jobs (on MacOS) to facilitate automatic site generation has been added (under the menu item 'Jekyll')

And lastly the version numbers for bundler and rake have been updated.
