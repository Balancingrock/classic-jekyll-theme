Issue: Firefox will not display the icon in the banner or menubar. Other browsers seem to work fine.

Problem: Firefox needs the '::after' attribute for url content to be injected properly.

Issue is fixed in HEAD and will be part of upcoming release 2.4.0. 

Note that a release date for 2.4.0 has not been set. Please upgrade to HEAD to fix this issue.
