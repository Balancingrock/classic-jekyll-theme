This release fixes issues #11 and #13

There is a small additional benefit that fixing #13 also created the opportunity for a slight performance improvement that may be noticeable on sites that use many pages.

The changed files are:

- _includes/menubar.html
- _includes/widgets/categories.html

This release is fully backward compatible with the previous release. Upgrading is recommended for all users.

Version mixup: On github release 2.1.0 and 2.1.1 are identical. On rubygems release 2.1.0 does not have the #11 fix.
