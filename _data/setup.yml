# Classic Jekyll Theme settings

# Classic uses three columns Primary, Secondary and Tertiary.
# The primary column is always present and cannot be manipulated.
# The secondary column is optional and is either to the left or to the right of the primary.
# The tertiary column is optional and if present will be opposite the secondary column in the wide display and below the secondary in the medium display.
# In the narrow display all three columns will be below each other (if present)
# If the tertiary column is used, the secondary column *must* also be used.

# Controls the placing and visibility of the secondary column
# Values: left | right | none
# - left: The secondary column appears on the left side of the main column
# - right: The secondary column appears on the right side of the main column
# - none: There is no secondary column (note that this also inhibits the tertiary column)
# Here the default value is defined, pages may override this in their front matter.
# The secondary column must reside in the "_includes" directory and is called "secondary-column.html"
# Front matter can specify a different file for the secondary column ("secondary-column-content").
#
secondary-column: left

# Controls visibility of the tertiary column
# Values: present | none
# - present: The tertiary column is visible.
# - none: There is no tertiary column.
# The tertiary column is always on the opposite side of the main column from the secondary column.
# Here the default value is defined, pages may override this in their front matter.
# The tertiary column must reside in the "_includes" directory and is called "tertiary-column.html"
# Front matter can specify a different file for the tertiary column ("tertiary-column-content").
#
tertiary-column: present

# A subtitle can be displayed in de banner
#
subtitle: "easy to use and highly customizable"

# Skip some of the build process for faster recompilation during content creation.
# Values: yes | no
# - yes: If the jekyll.environment variable is *not* set to 'production', then various aspects (menu, categories) are skipped during jekyll compilation. This speeds up the content development cycle quite a lot.
# - no: Always generate the site completely.
#
# Currently applies to the dropdown menu, the vertical-menu, the categories (widget), the older-posts widget and the recent-post widget.
# Since the menu structure is not available for site navigation, use the url to view the content under creation. Or first view the new content, then enable fast content build and use refresh in the browser.
#
fast-content-build: no

# Use site favicons as generated by the website: https://realfavicongenerator.net.
# Values: yes | no
# - yes: Upload the image to be used as favicon to that site, create a favicon files folder called 'icons', download the generated file/folder and replace the contents of the site's icons directory with the files from realfavicongenerator.
# - no: The folder 'icons' can be removed.
#
realfavicongenerator: yes

# For the number of posts visible on the home page.
# Value: > 0
#
number-of-posts-on-home-page: 5

# For the number of posts titles shown in the 'recent' widget
# Value: > 0
#
number-of-recent-posts-in-widget: 10

# Enables or disables the cookies warning.
# Values: yes | no
#
enable-cookies-policy: no

# Controls the position of the banner and menubar.
# Values: top | main | top-fixed
# - top: The navigation banner will be placed above all the columns
# - main: The navigation banner will be placed inside the main column at the top.
# - top-fixed: The navigation banner will be placed above all the columns and remain in place when scrolling down.
# This is the default value, pages may override this in their YAML frontmatter. But beware the anchor offset!
#
# $anchor-top-fixed-offset-xxxxx should be zero for 'top' and 'main' and should be set to the banner-area height
# for 'top-fixed'. (See classic-jekyll-theme.scss)
#
# Hint 1: When the 'top-fixed' is used a background color should be specified for the banner and menu.
# Hint 2: It is recommended not to use the youtube-player widget when using 'top-fixed'. Because the youtube-player widget will scroll in front of the banner.
#
banner-position: top

# Switches between drop-down menu's en the vertical-menu for the subMenuTitles. It does not affect the top menu items with the exception of the 'Categories' item.
# Only works for medium and widest layouts, the narrow layout always used the menubar instead of the vertical-menu. (Which is displayed vertically anyhow)
# Values: yes | no
# - yes: The drop down menu is used, the vertical menu is not shown. The Categories menu item is generated when the generate-categories-menu is set to 'yes'.
# - no: The vertical menu is used, the drop down menu is not shown. The Categories menu is not created, even when the generate-categories-menu is set to 'yes'.
#
# Note 1: The drop down menu does not display sub-sub menu items, the vertical menu does.
# Note 2: When the drop-down menus are not used, any items in the menubar without a linked page will become useless.
# Note 3: Setting to 'no' will result in slower compilation. If possible, setting this to 'yes' during content development will help speed up the workflow.
#
drop-down-menu: yes 

# Controls the generation of the categories menu entry in the menu bar if the drop-down-menu option is set to 'yes'. Has no impact on the categories widget.
# Values: yes | no
# - yes: The categories menu entry is generated if -and only if- the drop-down-menu option is set to 'yes'.
# - no : The categories menu entry is not generated.
#
generate-categories-menu: no

# Create a separate file containing the banner and menubar.
# Values: yes | no
# - yes: An external file will be used to store the menubar.
# - no: Generated the menubar inline.
#
# This option uses javascript. Choosing 'yes' will download the jQuery javascript library from google.
#
# Using a separate banner-area file speeds up jekyll compilation a lot. However it also means that the browser has to make two additional fetches: the navbanner file and the jQuery library (the latter from google). This is mitigated by the fact that both files can be cached by the browser.
# If another jQuery library has to be used, edit the _includes/head.html file accordingly.
#
# Note 1: If this option is set to 'yes', then make sure the file 'banner-area.md' is present (can be found in the theme folder) in the same project folder as the index.md file.
#
# Note 2: When a separate navbanner file is used the menubar will not be able to highlight the active page.
#
# Hint: Keep this option set to 'yes' during content creation or site development (when jekyll auto regeneration is used). Then switch it back to 'no' for the version that is published.

use-separate-banner-menubar-file: no
