The home page shows a number of full posts. The number of posts shown can be set in `site.data.setup.number-of-posts-on-home-page`. By default this is set to _5_.

There is also a widget called _recent-posts_ which can be used to show date & titles of the most recent posts. The number of posts show can be configured in `site.data.setup.number-of-recent-posts-in-widget`.

Then there is a widget called _older-posts_ which can be used to show all previous posts in a summary/detail construction. I.e. with disclosure triangles that drill down from year to month.
