excerpt: Ruby and versioning hell
---
Versioning is a major headache for people doing more than 1 project. It is not called "Versioning Hell" for nothing.

Ruby is no exception. And using Jekyll for website development may in turn cause problems with other Ruby based projects.

We use [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) to solve this problem.

With [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) any Ruby based project can run in its own versioning environment. Recommended!
